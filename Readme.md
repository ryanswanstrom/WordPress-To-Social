# WordPress to Social

This is a project to make my blog the central point of all my social media posts.
So, I want to post content to my blog and I want that content to flow to my blog. 

This project will contain a number of Azure functions which will run on a daily basis, and check
for new blog content, and then post that content to the social media sites.

This will be a work in progress
